## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyber Sukraksha Port Scanner! This tool is designed to help you identify the current service running on an open port and determine if it is vulnerable to any known exploits. With cyber threats constantly evolving, it's crucial to have tools like this at your disposal to enhance your system's security posture.

## Features

- **Service Identification**: Quickly determine the current service running on an open port.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Assess whether the identified service is vulnerable to known exploits.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core language used for backend development.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for user interface and interaction.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **Socket (Python)**: Library used for network communication.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Cyber Sukraksha Port Scanner, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyber-sukraksha-port-scanner.git
   ```

## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository, you can use the Port Scanner as follows:

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the project directory and run the Flask application:
   ```
   cd cyber-sukraksha-port-scanner
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Scanner**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the Port Scanner interface.

3. **Enter IP Address**: Input the IP address you want to scan into the provided field and click the "Scan" button.

4. **View Results**: The Port Scanner will display the open ports along with the services running on them and their vulnerability status.

## Deployment

To deploy the Cyber Sukraksha Port Scanner for production use, follow these guidelines:

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have a suitable server environment configured with Python and Flask installed.

2. **Configure Application**: Modify any necessary configuration settings such as host and port in the Flask application.

3. **Deploy Application**: Deploy the application using your preferred deployment method, such as a cloud service provider or self-hosted server.

4. **Access Application**: Once deployed, users can access the Port Scanner using the provided URL.

With the Cyber Sukraksha Port Scanner deployed, you can efficiently scan for open ports and assess their vulnerability status to bolster your system's security defenses.
